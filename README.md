  <h2 style="color: #48C9B0;">ðŸš€ Key Features</h2>


   * All Your Lights in One Place: Automatically lists all compatible Maya and Arnold lights (aiAreaLight, aiSkyDomeLight, etc.) in a clean, organized table.
   * Instant Light Creation: Quickly create lights with descriptive names (e.g., "key," "rim"). The tool handles the technical naming (LGT_KEY_000) for a tidy scene.
   * Direct Attribute Control: Modify essential light attributes directly in the list â€” no need to select anything in the viewport:
       * Mute & Solo: Instantly toggle lights on/off with the 'M' checkbox, or isolate a single light's contribution with the 'S' (Solo) checkbox.
       * Interactive Adjustments: Tweak Exposure and Samples on the fly. You can even use Ctrl+Scroll or Shift+Scroll over the number fields for fine-tuned adjustments.
       * Color Picker: A color swatch gives you one-click access to Maya's color editor to change a light's color.
       * AOV Group Management: Assign lights to specific AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) directly from the UI.
   * Efficient Scene Management:
       * Search & Filter: Instantly find lights by name with the built-in search bar.
       * Rename & Delete: Safely rename or delete lights from the scene with a single click (deletion requires confirmation).
       * One-Click Render: Launch the Arnold RenderView with the dedicated "Render" button to immediately see your changes.
   * Real-Time Sync: The tool stays perfectly synchronized with your Maya scene. Any change you make in the Attribute Editor is instantly reflected in the Light Manager, and
      vice-versa.
