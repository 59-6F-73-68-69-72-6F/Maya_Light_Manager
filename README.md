Maya Light Manager (MLM)


The Maya Light Manager (MLM) is an intuitive tool designed to streamline the lighting process within Autodesk Maya, particularly for Arnold-oriented workflows.
It provides a centralized interface to efficiently manage and control lights in your scene, enhancing productivity and creative freedom.

Key Functionalities:

-    Comprehensive Light Listing: Automatically detects and lists all common light types present in your Maya scene, including standard Maya lights (Point, Spot, Directional) and Arnold-specific lights (Area, SkyDome, Photometric).

-    Intuitive Light Creation: Easily create new lights by selecting a type from a dropdown menu and assigning a custom name.
The tool automatically applies a consistent naming convention (e.g., LGT_KEY_000) for better scene organization.

-   Direct Light Selection: Select any light directly from the UI table, which instantly updates the selection in your Maya viewport, allowing for quick scene navigation and manipulation.

-   Visibility Control (Mute & Solo):

      - Mute (M): Toggle the visibility of individual lights on or off with a single click, perfect for isolating or temporarily disabling specific light sources.

      - Solo (S): Isolate a single light by making it visible while automatically hiding all other lights in the scene, enabling focused adjustments without distraction.

- Quick Property Modification: Directly adjust essential light attributes from the UI table:

  - Color: Access a color picker to precisely define the light's color.

  - Exposure: Modify the light's intensity using a numerical input field.

  - Samples: Adjust Arnold light samples for quality control directly within the table.

- Dynamic Scene Synchronization:
  - Refresh: Instantly update the light list to reflect any changes made directly in Maya, ensuring the UI always matches your scene state.
  - Attribute Sync: Changes made to light attributes (like Exposure or Samples) in the UI are immediately applied in Maya, and vice-versa, thanks to real-time synchronization.

- Efficient Light Management:
  - Rename: Easily rename selected lights directly from the UI, automatically applying the established naming convention.
  - Delete: Quickly remove selected lights from your scene with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

The Maya Light Manager is built to simplify complex lighting tasks, providing artists with immediate control and clear oversight of their scene.
